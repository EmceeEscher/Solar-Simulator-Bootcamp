MAP
1) using the MyMaps web interface, you can create/save a map, and then export to xml (see steps below)
	https://www.google.com/maps/d/splash?app=mp
	registered under: no one. I didn't bother saving them on MyMaps. 
	
2) The KML does not include elevations (and is a mess). You can use Google's Elevations API to get them

3) To display the map, we're using the JMapViewer library that works with Open Street Map. 
Documentation: https://josm.openstreetmap.de/doc/overview-summary.html

4) To make custom route on map when not possible on google map, use the website below
make the route, export as KML file then import the file into "google my maps" then add lables using
"Add marker" button. Then, export it as KML file again to have the file in the required format. 
Finally using ElevationScript.java add elevations to the file.

WEATHER
1) Forecast.io seems to do everything we need (gathers info from NASA and NOAA DB's in the back end)

2) U.S aviation weather (https://aviationweather.gov/adds/dataserver/tafs/TafsExamples.php)
Has all of the automated weather reports and forecasts (METARS and TAFs) from airports around the 'states.
There's a lot of them
Program Key/registered under: Don't seem to need one.
