/**


This class models the solar panels and their generating capacity, 
based on the variables in the environment.
See Stanford's simulator here: http://solarcar.stanford.edu/design/systems/strategy/
It would be awesome if this class could do that ^^ (minus the GUI of course)
Not entirely sure how it should pass the power to the ElectricalController (watts? Voltage and Current?)
